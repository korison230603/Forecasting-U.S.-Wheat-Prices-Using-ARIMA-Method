# Forecasting-U.S.-Wheat-Prices-Using-ARIMA-Method
This project aims to forecast wheat prices in the United States using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) method. The analysis is conducted using historical price data to build a time series model that captures trends and patterns in wheat price movements. This forecasting model can support stakeholders in agriculture, trade, and policymaking to anticipate price changes and make informed decisions.
# Dataset
Source: Investing.com
(The dataset includes daily/monthly wheat prices from a reliable U.S. agricultural statistics source.)
# Variables Used
- Date
- Wheat Price (USD)
# Methodology
The ARIMA method is applied for time series forecasting. The modeling process includes:
- Stationarity testing
- Differencing (if needed)
- Model identification (AR, I, MA parameters)
- Model fitting and validation
- Forecasting future wheat prices
